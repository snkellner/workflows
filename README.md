# workflows
WFA workflows.  Note that I will be sharing workflows starting from version 4.1.  And maybe later in version 4.2.  I do have a powershell module that can reversion dar files,  which is posted [here](https://github.com/wfaguy/powershell/tree/master/modules/ReversionWfa)

Each workflow has it's own folder and readme file.
